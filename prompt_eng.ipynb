    "Prompt engineering is using techniques when writing prompts to get better, and more consistent, responses from AI models like ChatGPT and Claude.  The more complex task the more benefit you will get from prompt engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt engineering techniques:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- give clear instructions\n",
    "- provide examples\n",
    "- set a persona\n",
    "- start a new chat if things go wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced techniques:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- XML tagging\n",
    "- Give the model time to think/ Break up complex tasks\n",
    "- Use format support for output consistency\n",

      "4. **Optimize for Each Platform**:\n",

      "\n",
      "5. **Monitor and Adjust**:\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Establish a Consistent Sleep Schedule**: Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. This helps regulate your body's internal clock and can make it easier to wake up naturally.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Create a Bedtime Routine**: Develop a relaxing routine before bed to signal to your body that it's time to wind down. This could include reading a book, listening to calming music, or practicing meditation or deep breathing exercises.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Limit Exposure to Screens Before Bed**: The blue light emitted by phones, tablets, and computers can interfere with your body's production of melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep. Try to avoid screens at least an hour before bedtime.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Optimize Your Sleep Environment**: Make sure your bedroom is conducive to sleep. Keep it cool, quiet, and dark, and invest in a comfortable mattress and pillows. Consider using blackout curtains and a white noise machine if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Use an Effective Alarm System**: Place your alarm clock across the room, so you have to get out of bed to turn it off. Consider an alarm with a loud, pleasant sound, or use a smartphone app that requires you to solve a puzzle or take a photo of something specific to turn it off, ensuring you're fully awake by the time it's off.\n"

      "1. **Read the Manual:** Start by consulting your car's owner's manual. It contains valuable information about your vehicle's specific features and maintenance requirements. Understanding your car's layout and specifications will make diagnosing problems easier.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Gather the Right Tools:** Make sure you have a basic set of automotive tools, including wrenches, screwdrivers, pliers, and a socket set. Specialized tools may sometimes be necessary depending on the repair, so identify what you'll need before you start a job.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Diagnose the Problem Accurately:** Before attempting any repair, make sure you accurately diagnose the issue. This could involve checking error codes with an OBD-II scanner, listening for unusual sounds, or visually inspecting components for damage or wear.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Use Online Resources and Tutorials:** There are numerous online resources available, including forums, YouTube videos, and repair guide websites like Haynes or Chilton. These can provide detailed step-by-step instructions and visuals, which can be extremely helpful, especially for DIY repairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Prioritize Safety:** Always prioritize your safety when working on your car. Ensure the car is on a flat surface and use jack stands if you need to work underneath. Wear safety goggles when necessary, disconnect the battery to prevent electrical issues, and be cautious when dealing with fluids and chemicals.\n",
      "\n",
